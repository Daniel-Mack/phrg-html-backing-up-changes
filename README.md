If you've been following along on these lessons using your own personal repository, adding, committing and pushing at the end of each, you've maintained an excellent git workflow.

Most often, its better to make more commits rather than less. Commit code whenever you've completed any particular thing you're proud of, or when you're done with a specific task. It is possible to access any of these commits in the future, in the event that you need to roll back to a previous version of a repository, or want to look at some code from the past you've since removed. More commits with specific messages regarding what was accomplished means a clearer picture of the path you took to create a project.
